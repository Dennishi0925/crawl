## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

1. yahoo相關關鍵字丟到dcard search
2. index data frame 創建, 加上標題, 連結, id等column
3. 拿index去抓每篇文, 記得加上ID
4. 分成主文跟回文的data frame
5. 資料清洗後上傳到google drive
6. 每小時重複task
7. 寫信通知

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
